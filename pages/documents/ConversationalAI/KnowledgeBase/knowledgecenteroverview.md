A bot is a great way to provide help and information. Consumers can ask questions to your bot conversationally, and the bot can respond with answers and links to relevant content. Information like this is provided to the bot using a knowledge base.

The Knowledge Base application in the Conversation Builder platform allows you to create and manage knowledge bases and articles, which are then processed by our NLU engine. This allows your bot to leverage [intents](intent-builder-intents.html) and [entities](intent-builder-entities.html) to recommend the most accurate articles to an inquiring consumer. FAQ bots and Agent Advisor widgets are both driven by a knowledge base full of articles, intelligently delivering the right content to the consumer at the right time.

### Settings toolbar

Inside a knowledge base, in the lower-right corner, you'll find a toolbar that provides access to the following panels:

* **Chat**: This panel allows you to select a bot that you've previously created and linked to the knowledge base, and feed it test user input to see if it matches content as you'd expect.

* **Tags**: This panel displays all tags that you've previously used, so you can review all of them in one place and reuse them in any future articles.

* **Categories**: This panel displays all categories that you've previously used, so you can review all of them in one place and reuse them in any future articles.

* **Test User Input**: This panel is similar to the first panel but is divorced from a specific bot. You can use it to feed user input directly into a knowledge base and test your content matching without the context of an actual dialog.

* **Knowledge Base Menu**: This panel provides access to various knowledge base settings and features.

* **Intents Analytics**: This is a data panel that shows you historical information on the intents that were and weren't matched to your knowledge base articles by bots.
