A bot is a great way to provide help and information. Consumers can ask questions to your bot conversationally, and the bot can respond with answers and links to relevant content. Information like this is provided to the bot using a knowledge base.

The Knowledge Base application in the Conversation Builder platform allows you to create and manage knowledge bases and articles, which are then processed by an NLU engine. This allows your bot to leverage [intents](intent-builder-intents.html) and [entities](intent-builder-entities.html) to recommend the most accurate articles to an inquiring consumer. FAQ bots and Agent Advisor widgets are both driven by a knowledge base full of articles, intelligently delivering the right content to the consumer at the right time.

Inside a knowledge base, in the lower-right corner, there's a toolbar that provides access to the following panels:

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_chat.png"> **Chat**: Use this to select a bot you've previously created and linked to the knowledge base, and feed it test user input to see if it matches content as you'd expect.

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_tags.png"> **Tags**: This panel displays all tags you've previously used, so you can review them all in one place and reuse them in future articles.

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_categories.png"> **Categories**: This panel displays all categories you've previously used, so you can review them all in one place and reuse them in future articles.

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_test.png"> **Test User Input**: This panel is similar to the Chat panel but is divorced from a specific bot. Use it to feed user input directly into a knowledge base and test your content matching without the context of an actual dialog.

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> **Knowledge Base Menu**: Use this to access to various knowledge base settings and features.

* <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_intentAnalytics.png"> **Intents Analytics**: Use this to see historical information on the intents that were and weren't matched by bots to the knowledge base articles.
