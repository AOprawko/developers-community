### Add a knowledge base

1. In the Dashboard, click **Add Knowledge Base** in the upper-right corner.
2. Specify the following:
    * **Data source name**: Enter a name for the knowledge base.
    * **Data source type**: Select "Knowledge Base."
    * **Language**: Select the language of the knowledge base. The default value is English. For details, see [here](knowledge-base-overview.html#languages) in the overview.
    * **Import articles from**: You can add articles manually, but if you have them in an external file, you can import them now. Select either "CSV" or "Google Sheet," and use the controls provided to upload the file's contents. For details on creating an import file, see [here](knowledge-base-knowledge-bases.html#create-an-import-file) below. 
        
        If you select "Google Sheet" and you provide the URL to the sheet, be aware that this establishes a link between the knowledge base and the sheet. If you later sync the knowledge base, it is updated with the current contents in the sheet. 

    * **Intent Association**: This field specifies where the intents reside, either in the knowledge base itself or in a domain in Intent Builder. Select either "Knowledge Base Intents" or "Domain Intents." If you select "Domain Intents," also select the domain from the list that appears. For a more in-depth explanation of these, see [here](knowledge-base-overview.html#knowlege-base-intents-versus-domain-intents) in the overview.
3. Click **Add**.

    This creates the knowledge base, and takes you to its search view. In this default view, you can search the title, intent qualifiers and content of articles.

### Create an import file

If you want to import a set of articles into a knowledge base when you add the knowledge base, you'll need to create the import file.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/kb_importFile.png">

**To create an import file**

1. Create a new CSV file or Google sheet.
2. Add the column headers listed below; use the order listed.
3. Fill out the rows with your article data. It's recommended that you complete at least these columns: tags, title, summary, alternates, and detail.

#### Column headers

| Column header name | Notes |
|--------------------|-------|
| id | An integer; usually just the row index, e.g., 1, 2, 3. <br><br>**Note**: This column isn't required when you initially create the knowledge base. However, if you're using a Google sheet that you plan to sync periodically, it does play a role then. Before performing a sync, update the Google sheet to include the "id" column and enter the IDs for all existing articles. |
| tags | A comma-separated list of relevant terms. |
| title | The article title. This should be a complete sentence or question that the user might ask. |
| summary | A short answer that's 80 characters or less. |
| alternates | In the UI, these are called "intent qualifiers." |
| detail | A long answer that's 350 characters or less. |
| content_url | |
| image_url | |
| audio_url | |
| video_url | |
| followupQuestion | Deprecated. |
| quickReplies | Deprecated. |
| inputContext | Deprecated. |
| contextAlternates | Deprecated. |
| outputContext | Deprecated. |
| category | Assigning a category lets you filter articles based on categories in the application. |
| section | |
| positiveLearnings | These are phrases for which you want a match to the article to occur. A comma-separated list. |
| negativeLearnings | These are phrases for which you don't want the article to appear in the result even if it is matched to the consumer's intent. A comma-separated list. |
| intentName | |

### Configure knowledge base settings

**To configure knowledge base settings**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Specify the following:
    * **Data source name**: Enter a new name for the knowledge base if desired.
    * **Data source type**: This field is read only.
    * **Language**: Change the language if desired.
    * **Import articles from**: After you've added a knowledge base, you can't subsequently import articles from a CSV file. However, you can link a Google sheet to the knowledge base though, but be aware that, once you sync with the sheet, the contents of the knowledge base are overwritten with what's in the sheet.
    * **Knowledge Base ID**: Read-only. This is a unique identifier that’s generated by the system. In some scenarios, you might need to reference the knowledge base ID. Here’s where you can find it.
    * **Intent Association**: This field is read only. However, if the knowledge base uses Knowledge Base intents, you can convert them to Domain intents; for help with this, see [below](knowledge-base-knowledge-bases.html#convert-knowledge-base-intents-to-domain-intents).
    * **Associated Domain for Entity**: This field is only displayed if the knowledge base uses Knowledge Base intents. If desired, you can change the domain where the entities used in the knowledge base are defined.
    * **Associated Domain**: This field is only displayed if the knowledge base uses Domain intents. If desired, you can change the domain where the intents and entities used in the knowledge base are defined.
    * **Account**: 
    * **Public**: If you don't want other users in your LiveEngage account to be able to view and edit the knowledge base, click the slider to Off. The default value is On.
4. Click **Update**.

### Convert Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents

When you convert Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents, the system takes each article title and creates an intent in the domain that you select, and it takes each associated intent qualifier and creates a training phrase for that intent.

Before taking this action, be certain about doing so. Once you convert the intents, you can no longer use Knowledge Base intents in the knowledge base. Also, this action irreversibly modifies the domain that you select.

**To convert from Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, and scroll down to the **Intent Association** section.
4. Click **Convert to Domain Intents**.
5. In the dialog that appears, select the domain.
6. In the confirmation dialog, click **Confirm**.
    
    This converts the intents and associates the selected domain.

### Add stop words

Stop words are words that aren't used by the NLU engine to score an utterance. These words are removed or ignored in the matching process.

You can add stop words to a knowledge base. Typically, this is done for words or phrases like your company name or brand name, as these words typically aren't needed for and don't help the scoring of an utterance.

{: .important}
There is a list of stop words that are applied by default; you can view that list here. You don't need to add these words.

**To add a stop word to a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, and scroll down to the **Stop Words** section.
4. Enter the word, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_add.png"> (Refresh icon).

### Sync with a Google sheet

After you've made changes to the Google sheet that's linked to the knowledge base, sync the knowledge base to update it with the content.

{: .important}
This action overwrites the content in the knowledge base with the content in the Google sheet, so use caution when performing this.

Before performing a sync, make sure the Google sheet includes the "id" column that contains the IDs for all existing articles. If it doesn't, update the sheet accordingly before syncing.

**To sync a knowledge base with a Google sheet**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, scroll down to the **Sync Google Sheet Data Source** section, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_syncGoogleSheet.png"> (Refresh icon).

### Refresh the intents

The intents for every article are stored in a cache that is updated automatically every 5 minutes. But if you've made a recent change to intents--either [Knowledge Base intents or Domain intents](knowledge-base-overview.html#knowlege-base-intents-versus-domain-intents)--and you want to immediately see the result of the changes, you can manually refresh the cache.

**To refresh the intents in a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, scroll down to the **Refresh Intents** section, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_refresh.png"> (Refresh icon).

### Download a knowledge base 

Download of a knowledge base creates a CSV file.

You might need to download a knowledge base for a few reasons:

* You added the initial set of articles to the knowledge base by importing a CSV file, and now you want to add more articles using an import file too. *The only way to do this is with a Google sheet*, so you plan to download the knowledge base to a CSV file, convert the CSV file to a Google sheet, add the new articles alongside the existing articles (**don't remove the existing articles**), and link the Google sheet to the knowledge base.
* You want to create a copy of the knowledge base by dowloading it and then adding a new knowledge base using the CSV as the import file.
* You want to move or copy the knowledge base to another environment.
* You want an extra measure of back-up, so you plan to archive the CSV file for safekeeping.

**To download a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, scroll down to the **Download Knowledge Base** section, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_download.png"> (Download icon).
4. Follow the browser prompts to access and save the CSV file to a location of your choice.

### Delete a knowledge base

Deleting a knowledge base is a non-recoverable action, so be certain about doing so before taking this action.

{: .important}
Ensure the knowledge base isn't being used in any [Knowledge Base integrations](conversation-builder-integrations-knowledge-base-integrations.html) before you delete it.

**To delete a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, scroll down to the **Delete Knowledge Base** section, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_delete.png"> (Delete icon).
4. In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes**.
