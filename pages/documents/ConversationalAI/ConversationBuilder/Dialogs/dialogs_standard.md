#### Dialog (Standard)

The default choice is a standard dialog.

### How an Automation Triggers a Dialog

A Dialog may be triggered by either simple [pattern matching](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-response-match-actions.html#pattern-matching) or [intent matches](conversation-builder-intent-builder-overview.html) within the Intent Domain that you have linked to the automation. It may also be triggered by an Interaction via a Next Step action. 

Once the automation recognizes the user statement via either of these methods, it triggers the corresponding Dialog, listening to user answers and responding as configured by the Dialog.
