A dialog is a group/flow of interactions that are triggered based upon consumer intent.

You can use the hamburger icon right next to the **+** icon to see a list of your different dialogs. Otherwise, they are displayed horizontally, in chronological order.

### Dialog types

### Create a new dialog

Click the **+** icon at the bottom left corner of the Automation Workspace to add a new Dialog. You'll be prompted to enter a new name for the Dialog (**we recommend using a standard naming conventions to name your Dialogs, to make them more sortable and easy to find**) and choose between the dialog types.
