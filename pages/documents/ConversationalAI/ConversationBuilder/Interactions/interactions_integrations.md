Integration interactions make programmatic (API) calls to retrieve or post data to external systems and/or to perform actions. Integrations simply perform their work and then execute the next action.

If an integration retrieves data, that data can be stored in custom fields, so you can use it in subsequent interactions. For information on how to display variable data in interactions, see here.

Integrations are similar to questions in that you can define conditions that each perform different next actions (based on which condition is met). One common use for this is to check whether the integration call was a success or failure and then to execute a next action thatâ€™s appropriate.

When you add an integration interaction, you need to select the API integration that the interaction should invoke. And then you can configure the rest of the interaction details the way you do for any interaction.
