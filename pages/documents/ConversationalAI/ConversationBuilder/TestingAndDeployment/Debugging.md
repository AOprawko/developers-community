The Debug window, which displays the conversation log, is a useful tool during bot development in a few ways.

First, if you're encountering unexpected behavior while previewing a bot, check the Debug window. Errors and failures are displayed in red, so you'll know at a glance if and where they occurred. 

Second, because the log provides a technical view of the underlying process flow that occurred during the conversation, it can deepen your understanding of how that processing works and support research. For example, you can use the log to identify the specific patterns or intents that were actually matched in the conversation.

Here's a visual overview of the Debug window:



- 1 = User ID. Click the "i" to display the user ID of the user for whom the log is displayed, i.e., the user used in the Preview window. The user ID is generated by the system.
- 2 = Details slider. Click the slider to toggle between compact and detailed output in the log window.
- 3 = Red formatting. Errors and failures are displayed in red, so you can spot them quickly.
- 4 = Timestamps. Move your mouse over the circle beside a logged event to display its timestamp.
