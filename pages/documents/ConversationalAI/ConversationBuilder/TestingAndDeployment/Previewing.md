The Preview tool lets you test a bot with a conversation, so it's a useful tool as you design, develop and test the bot.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:400px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/preview.png">

There are a few things to be aware of as you use Preview:

- The conversation doesn't go through LiveEngage, so there's no need to deploy an agent connector to use Preview.
- Messages are formmatted in HTML, and structured content is displayed. Keep this in mind if your targeted channel is a text-only channel like SMS.
- The Preview window toggles its display to show the Bot Logs window. For details on the Bot Logs window, see [here](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-debugging.html).

### Access Preview
**To access the Preview window**
- Click **Preview** in the upper-right corner.

### Reset the session

If you've already opened the Preview window and subsquently made changes to the bot while the Preview window is open (i.e., while the current session is active), you'll need to reset the session so that Preview can reflect those changes.

**To reset the session**
- Click **Reset Session** in the Preview window.
