The first screen that displays in the Analytics app is a list of all of your bots. Search or scroll through this list and click on the bot for which you want to see data.

### Views

After clicking on a bot, you will be brought to the Overview. Clicking on "Overview" in the upper-left will show all of the available views.

In any view for a bot, you will be able to change the date range and timezone in the upper-right.

In any view **other than the Overview**, you are able to download the results to a CSV file via the download button under the date filter.
