### Overview

Intent Analyzer is LivePerson's hub for tracking and maintaining intents in real time. It provides enhanced reporting and analytics for your bots and automation. You can leverage the consistent flow of data from Intent Analyzer to:

* Power next-generation analytics
* Orchestrate conversations with [Maven](maven-ai-overview.html)
* Build effective bots with [Conversation Builder](conversation-builder-bot-workspace.html)

Intent Analyzer integrates seamlessly with [Intent Builder](intent-builder-overview.html) to provide a powerful, unified system for intent modeling and management.

### Getting started

Before you begin, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-the-power-of-an-intent-driven-contact-center.html) for information on the benefits of an intent-driven contact center, the benefits of being an intent-centric management solution (ICMS), and common use cases.

To get started, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-overview.html#getting-started) for important information on enabling Intent Analyzer, getting permissions, and beginning with start packs versus manual setup.

### Enabling Intent Analyzer for intents

The instructions below will enable [Intent Analyzer](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-overview.html) for your intents.

When you enter Intent Builder, you will notice a column that tells you if a domain "Has Intent Analyzer" or not.

{: .important}
It is a best practice to only have one domain enabled for Intent Analyzer at a time. This is to minimize intent overlap.

Click on a domain of your choice. On the left side of the screen, you will see your list of intents. If an intent is enabled for Intent Analyzer, it will have a green dot to its left.

Under the Intents left-side dropdown, select "Enable Intent Analyzer" and select the intents in bulk.

{: .important}
It is a best practice to enable all intents within a domain for the best analysis.

You can view the enabled intents in the [Intent Analyzer dashboard](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html).
