LivePerson Applications are a code layer developed on top of LivePerson APIs which includes an `App_Install_Id` parameter. This parameter is received when registering a dedicated configuration manifest that defines its scope and components.

There are two different types of LivePerson Applications:

### Global LivePerson Applications

This type of Application needs to be be published to the Marketplace by a LivePerson Developer and will be available for all LP customers to install (use/onboard) and manage within the Applications area. Global applications are restricted to LivePerson only and can't be developed by 3rd party developers (for now).

### Private LivePerson Applications

A customer will be able to develop and use their own private LivePerson Applications. These applications wonâ€™t be published in the Marketplace.

This type of LivePerson Application will be installed manually by uploading a JSON Manifest based on the [LivePerson Application Installation schema](guides-le-applications-installing.html). This schema will be uploaded under the specific account.

### Quicklaunch menu

Applications can be added to the QuickLaunch menu in the LivePerson UI. For applications to be available in the QuickLaunch menu, some criteria have to be met. In case of a Private LivePerson Application the JSON Manifest should contain the following properties:

* `"quick_launch_enabled" : true`,

* non-empty `entry_uri`,

* the user profile should match one of the profiles listed in `enabled_for_profiles`.
