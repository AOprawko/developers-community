LivePerson Applications are a code layer developed on top of LivePerson APIs which includes an `App_Install_Id` parameter. This parameter is received when registering a dedicated configuration manifest that defines its scope and components.

There are two different types of LivePerson Applications:

### Private LivePerson Applications

A customer will be able to develop and use their own private LivePerson Applications. These applications wonâ€™t be published in the Marketplace.

This type of LivePerson Application will be installed manually by uploading a JSON Manifest based on the [LivePerson Application Installation schema](guides-le-applications-installing.html). This schema will be uploaded under the specific account.

### Global LivePerson Applications

**Global applications are restricted to LivePerson only and can't be developed by 3rd party developers (for now).**

This type of Application needs to be be published to the Marketplace by a LivePerson Developer and will be available for all LP customers to install (use/onboard) and manage within the Applications area.
