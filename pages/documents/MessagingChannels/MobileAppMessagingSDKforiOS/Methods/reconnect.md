When using SSO in an authenticated connection, an auth-code is passed to the SDK (see [showConversation](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-showconversation.html) API). The session in this case might have an expiration date (see [LPMessagingSDKTokenExpired](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-callbacks-index.html)). To reconnect with a new token, use the following 'reconnect’ API and pass the new token.

This method reconnects the conversation's connection for conversation query.
Reconnect open related webSockets and sync the converstion with its latest updates.

`func reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationCode: String)`
