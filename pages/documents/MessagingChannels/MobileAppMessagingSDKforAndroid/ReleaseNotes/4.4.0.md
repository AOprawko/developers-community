**Release date:** Update this

### Overview
Android Mobile Messaging SDK version 4.4.0 release offers a few powerful features and major bug fixes.

### Environmental Requirements
The Android Mobile Messaging SDK version 4.3.0 uses:
- Minimum API version 19
- Compile API version 28
- Target API version 28
- Maps SDK "com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:16.1.0"

**(unchanged from version 4.3.2)**


### New Features:
## getUnreadMessagesCount:

- Get the count of unread messages that are not yet received by the consumer's device. This API returns the count through the provided callback which is a sum of unread messages in the  open as well as closed conversation messages.
- When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the app’s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualization of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.
- This API method uses a threshold mechanism of 10 seconds. If this API is called within 10 seconds from the last request was made, the counter will be returned from SDK cache otherwise a new request to the server will be made to fetch the latest count. 

**Note:** 
- This new API is available from SDK version 4.4.0
- The SDK needs to be initialized before calling this API.

This API will allow the user to get the count of unread messages for all open conversations without the need to be registered to receive push notifications.

public static void getUnreadMessagesCount(String appId, LPAuthenticationParams authenticationParams, final ICallback<Integer, Exception> callback)
