### Introduction

The Engagement Window Customization API provides you with the ability to easily customize the look and feel of the web engagement window. Today, you can perform simple customization to the window by using the engagement window studio or by applying their own CSS in a non-standardized way. However, customizing the window via non-standard CSS risks being affected by changes made to the engagement window by LivePerson in the future.

By exposing this API, we created a customization standard that is backward compatible using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). A list of "reserved" CSS classes was created, following a common naming convention and structure, which will remain untouched by LivePerson. This guarantees that any customization remains in place.

The API added classes to most of the window UI elements and supports both chat and and web messaging. 

### Use Cases

* Customize the engagement window for the web in a standardized way.
