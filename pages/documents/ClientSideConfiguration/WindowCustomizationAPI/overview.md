### Introduction

The Engagement Window Customization API provides brands with the ability to easily customize the look and feel of the web engagement window.

Today brands can perform simple customization to the window by using the engagement window studio or by applying their own CSS in a non-standardized way. By exposing this API we create a customization standard that is backward compatible using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

The API includes the window UI elements and supports chat and and web messaging. 

Brands that customize the window risk being affected by changes made to the engagement window. This API guarantees that the customization you make will not break. Therefore it is recommended to switch to the API.

### Use Cases

* Customize the engagement window for web in a standardized way
