Conversation Builder allows users to configure API integrations that are invoked when processing a dialog. Integrations are useful for sending or receiving necessary data from other systems.

The Conversation Builder [templates](conversation-builder-templates-overview.html) include common integrations. For example, the [Simple FAQ](conversation-builder-templates-simple-faq.html) template includes a Knowledge Base integration.

Want some practice with integrations? [Tutorial #3](conversation-builder-getting-started-3-integrations.html) provides a walkthrough of adding one. You'll need to complete [tutorial #1](conversation-builder-getting-started-1-dialogs-and-patterns.html) and [tutorial #2](conversation-builder-getting-started-2-intents.html) first.

### Integration types
An integration can be one of the following types:

- **API**: Use this type to invoke an API that performs some action. For example, you might want to fetch data from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system or Content Management System (CMS). Or, you might want to query a brand internal API to get information needed to answer a question or to look up a customer's history.
- **Email**: Use this type to send an email.
- **Knowledge Base**: Use this type to search a knowledge base for articles.
- **LivePerson Agent Escalation**: Use this type to transfer the conversation to a human agent or another bot. For best practices when working with this integration type, see [here](conversation-builder-best-practices-transfer-to-an-agent-or-bot.html).
- **FaaS**: Use this type to invoke a function (`lambda`) that is deployed to the [LivePerson Functions](liveperson-functions-overview.html) (Function as a Service or FaaS) platform. There are no constraints here; if there is some custom logic (a function) you want to invoke with a bot, you can do it with a [FaaS integration](#add-a-faas-integration).

### Add a LivePerson Agent Escalation integration

{: .important}
The **Message To User** field is required, but if you don't want to send a message, you can enter "BLANK_MESSAGE". This satisfies the underlying, system requirement for a message, but it doesn't actually send one.

For best practices when working with this integration type, see [here](conversation-builder-best-practices-transfer-to-an-agent-or-bot.html).

### Add a FaaS integration
Use a FaaS integration to invoke a function (`lambda`) that is deployed to the [LivePerson Functions](liveperson-functions-overview.html) (Function as a Service or FaaS) platform.

Before you add a FaaS integration in Conversation Builder, you must create and deploy the function using the LivePerson Functions UI. For help with this, see [here](liveperson-functions-getting-started.html).

{: .important}
 Be aware that Conversation Builder always invokes a function by its ID, which means that the use of events to invoke a function within a conversation flow isn't supported.

**To add a FaaS integration**

1. Open the automation, and click **Integrations** in the upper-left corner.
2. Configure the integration settings:
    - **Integration Name**: Enter the name of integration. Enter a name that's meaningful (it describes well the integration's purpose), concise, and follows a consistent pattern. This helps with organization, and it makes it easier for bot developers to work with the integration during bot development.
    - **Response Data Variable Name**: Enter the name of the response data variable.
    - **Integration Type**: Select **FaaS**.
    - **Function**: Select the function (`lambda`) to invoke via this integration. You can select from all functions added under your LivePerson account. Each is listed with its status.
    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_faaSFunctionList.png">
    The Function list provides an easy pass-through to the Functions UI in case you still need to create or modify the relevant function. Clicking **Create New Function** or <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_pencilModify.png"> (pencil icon) beside a function name opens a new browser window and prompt you to log into the Functions UI where you can do the work. Once done, return here and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_functionReload.png"> (reload icon) to refresh the Function list if needed.
    - **Function Headers**: Add the necessary data in key/value pairs to pass into the request via the header.
    - **Function Payload**: Enter the payload to pass into the function.
    - **Transform Result Script**: If applicable, use this section to write JavaScript code that transforms the raw result into JSON format, so you can use the information in the automation's dialogs. For more on this, see [Transform an API result](#transform-an-api-result) farther below.
    - **Custom Data Fields**: Add the fields that will store the result data in key/value pairs. Users who are tasked with creating automations can use and display this data in interactions by referencing these fields as described [here](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-interactions.html#display-variables-in-interactions).
3. Click **Save**.

### Transform an API result

You can invoke non-LivePerson APIs from Conversation Builder. With JavaScript code, you can process the responses (typically in a JSON format) and use the information within the dialogs of your bot.

The following screen from the API integration setup shows that you must remember to use the "Response Data Variable Name" with the “api_” prefix when it comes to **_Transform Result Script_** (the place where you manipulate the API response as you want).

<img class="fancyimage" width="550" src="img/ConvoBuilder/bestPractices/tips_integration-setup.png">

1. Get the raw API response and save it in a variable:

    ```javascript
    var getContextData = botContext.getBotVariable("api_GetContext");
    ```

2. Turn this into a JavaScript object, so you can access the properties:

    ```javascript
    var getContextJsonResponse = JSON.parse(getContextData.jsonData);
    ```

    If you were to debug log the `getContextJsonResponse`, this would give you an object such as:

    ```json
    {
        "api_GetContext" : {
            "_id": "5d15f436966b92b943be9219",
            "index": 5,
            "guid": "4f60a28d-3eae-4f2d-abd2-184931b57c6e",
            "isActive": false,
            "balance": "$1,023.36",
            "picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
            "age": 23,
            "eyeColor": "blue",
            "name": {
                "first": "Moon",
                "last": "Petty"
            },
            "company": "KONGENE",
            "email": "moon.petty@kongene.ca",
            "phone": "+1 (962) 489-3119"
        }
    }
    ```

    {: .important}
    The first property of that object is named `api_GetContext`, so adjust this with whatever the name you gave to your Bot Response Variable when defining the integration and append to the “**api_**” prefix.

3. Clean the JSON.

    To access the actual JSON from your response, you would need to perform one more extraction like this to make it easier to reference:

    ```javascript
    var jsonResponse = getContextJsonResponse.api_GetContext;
    ```

    Where `jsonResponse` would now be:

    ```json
    {
        "_id": "5d15f436966b92b943be9219",
        "index": 5,
        "guid": "4f60a28d-3eae-4f2d-abd2-184931b57c6e",
        "isActive": false,
        "balance": "$1,023.36",
        "picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
        "age": 23,
        "eyeColor": "blue",
        "name": {
            "first": "Moon",
            "last": "Petty"
        },
        "company": "KONGENE",
        "email": "moon.petty@kongene.ca",
        "phone": "+1 (962) 489-3119"
    }
    ```

4. Extract the key/value pairs from the JSON-format response and create bot-level variables as required.

    This means you can now access the various properties directly via these lines of code:

    ```javascript
    var company = jsonResponse.company;
    var guid = jsonResponse.guid || false;
    var age = jsonResponse.age || false;
    var email = jsonResponse.email || false;
    ```

    {: .important}
    The `|| false` construction means if the requested value does not exist, we will return false. This allows us to easily check later on if this was populated. (You could also use **null** in place of false if you prefer, as that is a **FALSE** value within JavaScript when it comes to conditional comparisons.)

5. Set bot-level variables using those values and output them within a text interaction:

```javascript
botContext.setBotVariable("guid", guid, true, false);
botContext.setBotVariable("age", age, true, false);
botContext.setBotVariable("email", email, true, false);
botContext.printDebugMessage("*** checking values were set: " + guid + age + email);
```

<img class="fancyimage" width="500" src="img/ConvoBuilder/bestPractices/tips_image_40.png">

### Check the API response status

You can obtain the HTTP status code of the API response using this special variable syntax:

```javascript
var statusCode = botContext.getBotVariable("api_<RESPONSE DATA VARIABLE NAME OF INTEGRATION>Status");
```

So, for an API Integration with the following settings:
* Integration Name = `RegisterNamespace`
* Response Data Variable Name = `RegisterNamespace`

You would get the response status code by using the following:

```javascript
var statusCode = botContext.getBotVariable("api_RegisterNamespaceStatus");

botContext.printDebugMessage(">>> api_RegisterNamespaceStatus statusCode:" + statusCode);
```

You can then check if the value matches the desired HTTP response code for successful operation and then proceed to trigger the next desired message interaction within your dialog.

```javascript
if (statusCode === 204 || statusCode === 201) {
    botContext.printDebugMessage(">>> api_RegisterNamespaceStatus API success");
    botContext.setTriggerNextMessage("saveContext");
} else {
    botContext.printDebugMessage("!!! api_RegisterNamespaceStatus API failure");
    botContext.setTriggerNextMessage("sdeSender_FAILED");
}
```

Typically, this block of code is placed in the POST PROCESS section attached to calling an API integration within a dialog.

### OAuth2 configuration

Conversation Builder supports simple key based authentication for API integrations as well as OAuth2 authentication. This allows any bots built on Conversation Builder to make API calls that require an access token that is obtained via the OAuth2 protocol.

#### Credentials

Conversation Builder allows you to store credentials for every organization. One of the supported types is OAuth2 credentials that the resource owner will have to create. 

#### API integration

Conversation Builder allows you to attach credentials to bot API integrations. When the bot is processing a dialog and needs to call an API integration as part of dialog flow, then it will use the associated credentials to authenticate and perform necessary actions.

#### Example guide with Salesforce

1. Credentials view:

    Go to Accounts -> Choose your organization.

    <!--<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_0.png">-->

    Click the 3 dots and choose Credentials.

2. Create new credentials.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:950px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_1.png">

    Click Add Credentials.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_2.png">

    Choose a name and the type as OAuth 2.0. Click Next.

3. Set the callback/redirect uri in the resource:

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_3.png">

    Click copy, and it will copy the redirect URI to your clipboard.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_4.png">

    Set that redirect URI in Salesforce (or any other resource), and save.

4. Authorize:

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_5.png">

    Set all the necessary fields from the OAuth2 configuration in your app, and click Authorize.

    {: .note}
    Scope is optional.

    This step will persist the credentials and will proceed to authorizing them with the resource. Next time you have to authorize with the same credentials, you can skip all the previous stages and authorize the existing credentials from the credentials view.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_6.png">

    You will get redirected to Salesforce (or any other resource) for authentication. If a session is already cached, then you might be redirected immediately back to Conversation Builder, or you’ll have to allow the authorization.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_7.png">

    If all credentials are valid, you will be redirected back to Conversation Builder, and you’ll see that pop-up. At this point, the token is persisted in Conversation Builder and can be used freely by bots.

5. Attach credentials to a bot’s API integration.

    Create an API integration for the bot. Create it as if it is an unauthenticated API.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/oauth2_image_8.png">

    Attach the relevant credentials to the API integration. The bot will automatically enhance the request based on the credentials’ type and data.

### Delete an integration
If the bot is no longer using a particular integration, you might want to delete the integration. Before doing so, make sure there are no integration interactions that reference the specific integration.

Deleting an integration affects only the bot for which it's been added.

**To delete an integration**

1. In the bot, click **Integrations**.
2. In the left panel, move your mouse over the integration name, and click the <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ellipsis.png"> icon that appears.
3. Click **Delete Integration**, and then click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog that appears.

### Display integration data in an interaction

For information on how to take the data that's retrieved by an integration call and stored in custom data fields, and display it in a bot interaction, see [here](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-interactions.html#display-variables-in-interactions).
