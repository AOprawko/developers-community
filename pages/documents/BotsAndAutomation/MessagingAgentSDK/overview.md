The Messaging Agent SDK (Node.JS) was built in order to help developers and our partners quickly integrate a messaging bot into the LiveEngage framework, enabling the bot to handle consumer conversations, escalate to a human when needed, and programmatically perform all agent actions.

[Here are the API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).


### Getting Started

[To access the Messaging Agent SDK, click here](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/node-agent-sdk). Below you can find an overview video describing bots, LiveEngage and the benefits of using them on top of our platform. For more info on the different methods which the SDK uses, please refer to the Repository's readme file. For more info on the different examples, you can refer to the same file or check out the "examples" page of this document.
