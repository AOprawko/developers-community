Mavenâ€™s AI powered routing provides a centralized experience to create dynamic policies to achieve routing to best human agent (direct, skill) or bot, based on intent and/or context attributes such as consumer profile data, operational context (load, predicted wait times, KPIs), and conversation history. Some examples of policies you can create: 

1. **When** brand suffers an exceptional **event** (storm, incident)  **route** to a bot for **intents** related to the outage. For all other intents (e.g. billing) route to human agent pool. 

2. **Route** a group of **intents** (e.g. order enquiry, cancellation, scheduling) to general order skill, **unless** customer is a **VIP**, then send them to their **Dedicated Advisor**

3. **For** lost baggage **intent**, return to **same agent** if customer is **returning within a time period**; for **premium** **elite** customers route to high priority skill
