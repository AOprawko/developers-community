### Overview

The FaaS Command Line Interface (CLI) is an open-source command-line tool provided by LivePerson that enables developers to create, edit and process their Lambda codes on their local development machines, in their favorite IDE of their choice. That way itâ€™s very easy to keep the source code under version control in any SCM.

The CLI offers nearly all functionality from the platfrom (e.g. deploy, undeploy and invoke). 

Besides that it offers many commands to support developers during the development of a lambda (e.g. pull, push and debug functions).
