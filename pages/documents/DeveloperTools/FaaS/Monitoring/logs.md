### Overview

To support developers in analyzing `lambdas` as they work, we support logging functions. This feature gives you the ability to add logs to your `lambdas`, in order to monitor the execution & behaviour of your function.

These logs will be stored after every `lambda` invocation (except manual invocation) for 30 days. You are able to view these logs in the [LivePerson Functions UI](#logs-section). How to log is described in the next chapter below [Logging Function behavior](#logging-function-behavior).

### Logging Function behavior

[Missing Screenshot]: <> (Let's add a screenshot of the IyF log result screen here.)

The different log-levels are: `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`. All functions take a string as a log message and, as an optional parameter, objects which can be displayed when inspecting an individual log item. An example for a function which is logged can be found in the [LivePerson Functions Templates](function-as-a-service-templates.html) (under "*Logging Template*").

The template for the logging functions is as follows:

```javascript
console.<info/debug/warn/error>(<message> [, extras])
```

<table>
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Component</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Notes</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>log-level</td>
    <td>Method</td>
    <td>Method names correspond to the different log-levels and influence in which way the logs are displayed within LivePerson Functions. Current levels are:
console.debug(), console.info(), console.warn() and console.error()</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>message</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>Message defines the message to be displayed in the logs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>extras</td>
    <td>Any</td>
    <td>An object which will then be wrapped in an Array and displayed in the log for additional information.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Example code for logging a function**:

```javascript
function lambda(input, callback) {
	console.debug('This is a simple debug message', {
		'bugs': 'none!'
	});

	console.info('Informing you about important news', new Date(), Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);

	try {
		console.warn('Starting a non-existent function');
		nonExistentFunction();
	} catch (e) {
		console.error('You cannot call what you did not create');
	}

	callback(null, 'Function has finished...');
}
```
<div class="important">
<ul>
<li>This function allows you to log sensitive information since there's no sanitation or limitations on the string you pass to the method! Please be considerate with what is logged and don't pass any sensitive information to this function, e.g a token or password.</li>
<li>Logs are only stored without a <b>Debug</b> level on external invocation.</li>
<li>Logs with a <b>Debug</b> level will only be shown on manual invocation.</li>
<li>Logs written during external invocation are limited to 10 entries, with an overall maximum of 5000 characters per lambda invocation. If this limit is exceeded, only one error log with information about which limit was reached will be logged.</li>
<li>Logs are only kept for 30 days. Older logs will be deleted.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Accessing Logs Storage

Our LivePerson Functions User Interface allows developers to investigate `lambda` logs.

The logs can be accessed via the **Functions** section by clicking on the logs icon, or directly in the [Logs section](#logs-section) in the navigation bar (see second picture below).

### Logs section
On this page you can search through the stored `lambda` logs (see second picture below).
![](img/faas-logs.png)

To see the logs the following parameters must be set:

1. **Function**: The `lambda` the logs should be displayed for
2. **Log Levels**: The **log levels** you want to see (selecting no **log level will cause all levels to be displayed**)
3. **Start Date**: The timestamp from which the logs will be shown (only the last 30 days can be selected)
4. **End Date**: The timestamp to which the logs will be shown (must be after **Start Date**)

After selecting the parameters, a click on the **SEARCH** button will show you the logs for the parameters set.

<div class="important">the maximum timespan between <b>Start Date</b> and <b>End Date</b> is restricted to 7 days</div>
