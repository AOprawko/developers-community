### Overview
LivePerson Functions currently supplies the user with basic metrics of their account such as the number of lambdas and function invocations.

 The *Home* section displays the metrics of the current brand account in realtime. These metrics include:

- **Total Functions** displays the current number of functions of the brand. This number includes *draft* and *productive* functions as well as the maximum allowed functions of the account.
- **Deployed Functions** shows the current number of functions with a *productive* state in addition to the maximum allowed *productive* lambdas of the current brand account.
- **Total Invocations** represents the total number of invocations for that brand account since the beginning the current month. This number includes *successful* and *unsuccessful* invocations.
- **Fair Use Quota** displays the number of invocations since the 1st of the current month and whether or not the *Fair Use Quota* has been reached. For additional information on the Fair Use Quota please visit the link [here](https://developers.liveperson.com/liveperson-functions-fair-use.html).
