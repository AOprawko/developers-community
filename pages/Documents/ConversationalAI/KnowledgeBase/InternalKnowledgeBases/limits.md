As you add and manage articles, there are a number of validation checks that are performed by the system to enforce limits and thereby promote best practices. 

Starting in late September 2020, these limits are enforced by the application. However, internal knowledge bases created before this time are exempt; you are only warned that you are exceeding the limit in question. The add or update operation is still permitted.
