For a flexible architecture and an optimal consumer experience, follow these best practices:

* Before you begin, ensure the content in the CMS is appropriate for conversational AI.
* Design a modular approach, where each knowledge base supports a particular classification in your business: Create CMS knowledge bases per category, likewise split the intents into domains based on category, and add multiple knowledge base integrations for use in bots. A modular approach like this makes it easier to use a knowledge base for a specific purpose in a bot. Moreover, it yields a faster response during the conversation.
* When you add a CMS knowledge base, configure it to use LivePerson AI whenever possible, and consider caching the fetched content at run time for improved performance.
* When using a CMS knowledge base with LivePerson AI, remember to manually [sync with the CMS](knowledge-base-cms-knowledge-bases-cms-kbs-with-liveperson-ai.html#sync-with-the-cms) after you make changes in the CMS.
