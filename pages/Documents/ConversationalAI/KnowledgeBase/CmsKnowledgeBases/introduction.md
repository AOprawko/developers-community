### About CMS knowledge bases

If you have a CMS with well-curated content that you want to leverage in bot conversations, you can add a CMS knowledge base. This is one where the content is authored and managed entirely within the external CMS application. Integrating with your CMS lets your content creators use familiar tools and workflows to author and manage the content.

You can integrate with any CMS that has the capability, i.e., an API connector. Notable examples include Salesforce and Zendesk. 

Within the Knowledge Base application, a CMS knowledge base serves as a connector to the CMS. You can configure the knowledge base so that the content is selected and served:

* [Using LivePerson AI](knowledge-base-cms-knowledge-bases-cms-kbs-with-liveperson-ai.html). (**Recommended**) 
* [Without using LivePerson AI](knowledge-base-cms-knowledge-bases-cms-kbs-without-liveperson-ai.html). In this case, the knowledge base uses the CMS' query and answer API for article suggestions/answers. (Every CMS can have a different name for this API.)

### Getting started with a draft KB

Adding a CMS knowledge base can take some time, so Knowledge Base automatically saves your changes in a "draft" once you start the process. This allows you to stop when you need and return to the task at a later time.

You can find your "draft" CMS knowledge bases at the top of the dashboard that displays all your knowledge bases. A knowledge base is considered no longer "draft" once all required fields are completed for the first time.

Keep in mind that completing the initial setup of a knowledge base, thereby moving out of "draft" status, doesn't indicate a proper configuration. You must test the knowledge base to verify this. Additionally, be aware that a knowledge base never returns to "draft" status if you subsequently remove required information.
