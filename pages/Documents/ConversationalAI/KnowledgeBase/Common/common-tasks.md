This topic contains information on tasks that are relevant to both CMS knowledge bases and LivePerson knowledge bases.

### Download a knowledge base 

Download of a knowledge base creates a CSV file.

You might need to download a knowledge base for a few reasons:

* You added the initial set of articles to the knowledge base by importing a CSV file, and now you want to add more articles using an import file too. *The only way to do this is with a Google sheet*, so you plan to download the knowledge base to a CSV file, convert the CSV file to a Google sheet, add the new articles alongside the existing articles (**don't remove the existing articles**), and link the Google sheet to the knowledge base.
* You want to create a copy of the knowledge base by downloading it and then adding a new knowledge base using the CSV as the import file.
* You want to move or copy the knowledge base to another environment.
* You want an extra measure of back-up, so you plan to archive the CSV file for safekeeping.

**To download a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base.
2. In the upper-right corner, click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ellipsisVertical.png">, and select **Knowledge Base Menu**.
