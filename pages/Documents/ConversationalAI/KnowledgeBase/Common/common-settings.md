This topic contains information on settings that are common to knowledge bases of various types.

Common settings include:

* **Knowledge Base ID**: Read-only. This is a unique identifier that’s generated by the system. In some scenarios, you might need to reference the knowledge base ID. Here’s where you can find it.
* **Account**: If you logged into Conversation Builder directly (i.e., not via single sign-on from Conversational Cloud) and you have access to multiple organizations within your Conversational Cloud account, you can use this setting to change the organization under which this knowledge base exists. If you logged into Conversation Builder via single sign-on from Conversational Cloud, the organization you were using in Conversational Cloud is active and can't be changed, and nothing appears in this list.
* **Public**: If you don't want other users in your Conversational Cloud account to be able to view and edit the knowledge base in the Knowledge Base application, click the slider to Off. To facilitate the contributions of multiple persons to articles, the default value is On.
