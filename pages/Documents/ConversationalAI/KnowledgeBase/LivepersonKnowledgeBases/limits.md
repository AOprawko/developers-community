As you add and manage articles, there are a number of validation checks that are performed by the system to enforce limits and thereby promote best practices. For knowledge bases created **after the September 2020** release, the limits are enforced by the application. However, for knowledge bases created before this time, you are only warned that you are exceeding the limit in question; the add or update operation is still permitted.
