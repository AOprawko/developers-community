### What's an external knowledge base?

If you have a CMS that you want to leverage in bot conversations or through Agent Assist, you can add an external knowledge base without needing to migrate your content. This is one where the content is authored and managed entirely within the external CMS application. Integrating with your CMS lets your content creators use familiar tools and workflows. You can integrate with any CMS that has the capability, i.e., an API connector. Notable examples include Salesforce and Zendesk. 

Within the Knowledge Base application, an external knowledge base serves as a connector to the CMS. You can configure the knowledge base so that the content is selected and served:

* [Using LivePerson AI](knowledge-base-external-knowledge-bases-external-kbs-with-liveperson-ai.html). (**Recommended**) Use LivePersonâ€™s AI to select the articles to respond to customer utterances.
* [Without using LivePerson AI](knowledge-base-external-knowledge-bases-external-kbs-without-liveperson-ai.html). Use the CMS' query and answer API for article suggestions/answers. (Every CMS can have a different name for this API.)

### Why use LivePerson's AI?

By using an AI-enabled knowledge base, you can offer your consumers a more helpful experience. AI-enabled knowledge bases use [Natural Language Understanding](intent-builder-natural-language-understanding.html) (NLU) technology to understand and intelligently match what consumers are asking for to articles in your knowledge base.

### Getting started with a draft KB

Adding an external knowledge base can take some time, so the Knowledge Base application gives you the option to save a knowledge base as a "draft." This lets you step away from the configuration work and come back to it at a later time.

Once you get into the process and have provided some basic information (e.g., a name), if you then click **Cancel**, you are prompted to choose whether to save your work.

Click **Yes** to save a draft.

You can find your "draft" external knowledge bases listed with your other knowledge bases in the main dashboard.
