Did you know that LivePerson has a Conversational AI forum for builders? Check it out [here](https://talkyard.livepersonai.com/)!

Use the Bots Status application to check the status of all your bots from a single location. 

You can use the application to monitor and manage both custom bots and post-conversation survey (PCS) bots.

### Access Bots Status

{: .important}
To access the Bots Status application, you must have the Bot Status Access [permission](bot-accounts-permissions.html).

**To access the Bot Status application**

1. On the left sidebar in Conversational Cloud, click the <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_cb.png"> icon.
2. In the Conversational AI dashboard, click **Bots Status**.

### Statuses

When monitoring bots, there are three types of statuses:

* **Bot Agent Connector**: This indicates the status of the deployed connector thatâ€™s connected to the bot and handles conversations using the bot.
* **Conversation Cloud**: This indicates the status of the connection between the bot agent connector and the Conversation Cloud messaging/chat server. This server sends the messages to the consumer via a channel.
* **Bot Server**: This indicates the status of the connection between the bot agent connector and the bot server. This server handles bot conversations.

To view a connector's statuses, scroll to the right in the dashboard.
