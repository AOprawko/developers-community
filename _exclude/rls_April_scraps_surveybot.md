- **Enable Bot**: This Online/Offline setting is only displayed for [survey bots](conversation-builder-bots-survey-bots.html), not for custom bots. Use it to turn a survey bot on and off. When the bot is online, it responds to user messages. When it is offline, it doesn't. Taking a published survey bot offline can be useful if you need to temporarily remove it from your customer traffic flow. The default value is Online.

DO WE DOUBLE DOC THE SURVEY BOT SETTINGS OR JUST PUT IN THE SURVEY BOT PAGE?

### Types of bots

There are two, general types of bots:

* **Custom bots**: A [custom bot](conversation-builder-bots-custom-bots.html) is one that you design to accomplish a specific business function, such as fetching a consumer's order status or creating an account for the consumer. You can create a custom bot from scratch, or you can start from a predefined, industry-specific template. Either method allows you to fully customize the bot to meet your needs.
* **Survey bots**: A [survey bot](conversation-builder-bots-survey-bots.html) lets you collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation with a custom bot or human agent. Use a survey bot to measure bot/agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on your quality targets.
