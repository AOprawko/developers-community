### Chat with a bot linked to a knowledge base

If you have a bot linked to your knowledge base via a [Knowledge Base integration](conversation-builder-integrations-knowledge-base-integrations.html), in the Knowledge Base application, you can feed test user input to the bot to see if it matches, returns and renders content as you'd expect.

If you're just getting started with knowledge bases and want to try using this tool, we recommend you create a bot using the [Simple FAQ bot template](conversation-builder-bot-templates-simple-faq.html) and connect it to your knowledge base. Most of the bot development work is already done. You only need to update the integration in the bot so that it uses your knowledge base, as shown in the image below.

**To chat with a bot linked to a knowledge base**

1. If you haven't already done so, in Conversation Builder, create a bot that includes a [Knowledge Base integration](conversation-builder-integrations-knowledge-base-integrations.html) that uses the knowledge base you want to test.
2. Return to the Knowledge Base application, and open the knowledge base.
2. In the upper-right corner, click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ellipsisVertical.png">, and select **Chat**.
4. In the Preview panel, select the bot to use.
