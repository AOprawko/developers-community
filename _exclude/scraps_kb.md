### Best practices

To increase the quality of your content matches, follow these best practices:

* The Knowledge Base returns results scored as VERY GOOD, GOOD, FAIR PLUS, FAIR and POOR. Generally, we set the responder to return results that are GOOD or better. You can downgrade the threshold to FAIR PLUS, but be sure to test to make sure the quality of the returned results meets your expectations.

### Add stop words

THIS FEATURE IS DEPRECATED - JUST HOLDING ONTO THIS CONTENT FOR SOME TIME

Stop words are words that aren't used by the NLU engine to score an utterance. These words are removed or ignored in the matching process.

You can add stop words to a knowledge base. Typically, this is done for words or phrases like your company name or brand name, as these words typically aren't needed for and don't help the scoring of an utterance.

{: .important}
There is a list of stop words that are applied by default; you can view that list [here](conversation-builder-best-practices-train-tune-nlu.html#nlu-stop-words). You don't need to add these words.
