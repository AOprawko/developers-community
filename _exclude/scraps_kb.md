### Best practices

To increase the quality of your content matches, follow these best practices:

* The Knowledge Base returns results scored as VERY GOOD, GOOD, FAIR PLUS, FAIR and POOR. Generally, we set the responder to return results that are GOOD or better. You can downgrade the threshold to FAIR PLUS, but be sure to test to make sure the quality of the returned results meets your expectations.

### Configure knowledge base settings

**To configure knowledge base settings**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Specify the following:
    * **Data source name**: Enter a new name for the knowledge base if desired.
    * **Data source type**: Ths field is read only.
    * **Language**: 
    * **Import articles from**:
    * **Knowledge Base ID**: Read-only. This is a unique identifier that’s generated by the system. In some scenarios (for example, when using some APIs), you need to reference the knowledge base ID. Here’s where you can find it.
    * **Intent Association**: This field is read only. However, if the knowledge base uses Knowledge Base intents, you can convert them to Domain intents; for help with this, see [below](knowledge-base-knowledge-bases.html#convert-knowledge-base-intents-to-domain-intents).
    * **Associated Domain for Entity**: This field is only displayed if the knowledge base uses Knowledge Base intents. If desired, you can change the domain where the entities used in the knowledge base are defined.
    * **Associated Domain**: This field is only displayed if the knowledge base uses Domain intents. If desired, you can change the domain where the intents and entities used in the knowledge base are defined.
    * **Account**: 
    * **Public**: If you don't want other users in your LiveEngage account to be able to view and edit the knowledge base, click the slider to Off. The default value is On.
4. Click **Update**.

### Convert Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents

When you convert Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents, the system takes each article title and creates an intent in the domain that you select, and it takes each associated intent qualifier and creates a training phrase for that intent.

Before taking this action, be certain about doing so. Once you convert the intents, you can no longer use Knowledge Base intents in the knowledge base. Also, this action irreversibly modifies the domain that you select.

**To convert from Knowledge Base intents to Domain intents**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, and scroll down to the **Intent Association** section.
4. Click **Convert to Domain Intents**.
5. In the dialog that appears, select the domain.
6. In the confirmation dialog, click **Confirm**.
    
    This converts the intents and associates the selected domain.

### Add stop words

Stop words are words that aren't used by the NLU engine to score an utterance. These words are removed or ignored in the matching process.

You can add stop words to a knowledge base. Typically, this is done for words or phrases like your company name or brand name, as these words typically aren't needed for and don't help the scoring of an utterance.

{: .important}
There is a list of stop words that are applied by default; you can view that list here. You don't need to add these words.

**To add a stop word to a knowledge base**
1. Open the knowledge base, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_settings.png"> (Knowledge Base Menu icon) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the Settings panel, click **KB Settings**.
3. Click **More Options**, and scroll down to the **Stop Words** section.
4. Enter the word, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_add.png"> (Refresh icon).
