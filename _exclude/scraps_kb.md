### Best practices

To increase the quality of your content matches, follow these best practices:

* The Knowledge Base returns results scored as VERY GOOD, GOOD, FAIR PLUS, FAIR and POOR. Generally, we set the responder to return results that are GOOD or better. You can downgrade the threshold to FAIR PLUS, but be sure to test to make sure the quality of the returned results meets your expectations.
