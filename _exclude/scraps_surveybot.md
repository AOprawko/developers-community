### Types of bots

There are two, general types of bots:

* **Custom bots**: A [custom bot](conversation-builder-bots-custom-bots.html) is one that you design to accomplish a specific business goal, such as fetching a consumer's order status or creating an account for the consumer. You can create a custom bot from scratch, or you can start from a predefined, industry-specific template. Either method allows you to fully customize the bot to meet your needs.
* **Survey bots**: A [survey bot](conversation-builder-bots-survey-bots.html) lets you collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation with a custom bot or human agent. Use a survey bot to measure bot/agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on your quality targets.
