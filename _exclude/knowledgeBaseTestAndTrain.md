Keep in mind the best practices discussed farther below on this page.

#### Search filters


#### Positive learnings (thumbs-up)

Positive learnings are phrases for which you want a match to the article to occur.


#### Negative learnings (thumbs-down)

Negative learnings are phrases for which you don't want the article to appear in the result even if it is matched to the consumer's intent.


### Preview a knowledge base with a bot

Q - Is this equivalent to preview in CB? Why use one over the other?

If you have a bot that's linked to a knowledge base, you can feed it test user input to see if it matches content as you'd expect.

**To preview a knowledge base with a bot**

1. Select the knowledge base, and then click <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_kb_chat.png"> (Chat) in the lower-right corner.
2. At the top of the Preview window, select the bot.
3. Feed the bot test user input and evaluate the results.
